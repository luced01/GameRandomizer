# GameRandomizer
A personal quality-of-life that chooses a random file in a selected folder.

Limited capabilities of launching from the application itself. Exe-files and shortcuts for Steam  should work, very limited functionality otherwise. 
Capable of saving the chosen folder after 1st run.

3rd iteration.
